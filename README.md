What is the project ?: i choose an Amazon product page and mock it

How I made it: -I chose a relativly simple page about a javascript book It doesn't have a lot of details nor does it have a complex middle section with photos -I split up the poject into multiple css files in order to make everything clean and readable for everyone, relevant file names for the sections has been chosen
